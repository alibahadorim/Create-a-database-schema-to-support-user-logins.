Create a database schema to support user logins.  Use an encryption algorithm to create a 1-way password hash
 
Create a database schema to support user logins. You should create a user lookup table. In the user lookup table, you should pre-create users for logging in. Use a flask page to accept a user login and typed password, compare the stored username & password, and return a success and a failed response in a web page.
Use an encryption algorithm to create a 1-way password hash (from the user creation process) and store the encrypted password in a user lookup table. Use the new encrypted password in your code that compares the user input hash with the stored hash.
